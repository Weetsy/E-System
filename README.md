# E-System

## Overview

This is a simple project with the goal of interacting with a cheap WaveShare ST7789V Controller 2-inch LCD using a Raspberry Pi Pico. This system runs on FreeRTOS and is designed to display simple graphics and text on the 2-inch LCD.

This system will initially be used to display speed/battery data on electric vehicles (E-bikes and E-skateboards), but will soon support recording distances traveled and energy consumption.

## Documentation and Use Cases

This software is not complete yet, so documentation on how to configure and use the setup will not yet be provided.
